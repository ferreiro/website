## Cross browser testing with BrowserStack

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.diogonunes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/browserstack-logo.png?resize=840%2C276" width="200px" style="float: left;" />

The blog post is getting thousands of readers. In order to make sure that we are able to offer the best possible experience across multiple devices we have teamed up with BrowserStack, a really powerful tool for performing cross browser testing.

## Run the server

We have all the configuration for beta and prod inside `./env/index.js`, there we load 2 files, the production or the development.

1. You'll need to create a `.env` file to set the required variables:
  ```
  NODE_ENV='DEV'
  SESSION_SECRET='keyboard cat'

  PORT=''
  MONGODB_URI=''
  ADMIN_EMAIL=''
  ADMIN_PASS=''
  MAILCHIMP_API_TOKEN=''

  S3_REGION=''
  S3_BUCKET=''
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=''

  CONTACT_EMAIL=''
  MAILGUN_USER=''
  MAILGUN_PASS=''
  RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC=''
  RECAPTCHA_SECRET=''
  NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=''
  ```
2. Source `.env`
3. Run the server `yarn dev`
